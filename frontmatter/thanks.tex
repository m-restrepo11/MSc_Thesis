Foremost, I would first like to thank my thesis adviser professor Andrés Fernando Reyes. Prof. Reyes was always open to help whenever I had a question about this work. He always guided me towards the right path. \\

I would also like to thank all my teachers and mentors throughout all these years of studying physics. Special thanks to Pedro Bargueño, Alonso Botero and Andrés Flórez for all the time, dedication and teachings. Thank you for showing me the beauty and joy in physics.\\

I am grateful to all my friends in the office with whom the best moments were enjoyed and the worst moments were endured. The I-118 was a blast with you guys.\\

Finally, I would like to profoundly thank my parents and my girlfriend for their continuous and unconditional love, support and comprehension. Thank you for your patience and encouragement. \\[2ex]
